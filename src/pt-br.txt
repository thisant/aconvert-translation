The server may be down or busy at the moment. It doesn't have enough CPU or memory resource to complete conversion. Tips: our servers are idle on weekends and holidays.
The conversion or the source format is not supported. For example, many users tried to convert WLMP file which is a movie project file that aconvert.com doesn't support.
The conversion queue is too long or the source file is too big or too complicated to be converted in time. We limit some conversions in 180 seconds. The conversion will be terminated when time is up.";
